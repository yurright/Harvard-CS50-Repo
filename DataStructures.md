# Data Structrues

## Arrays

<details>
<summary>Definition</summary>
  
- Arrays are linear data structures that store elements of the same data type in contiguous memory locations. They allow random access to elements, which means any element can be accessed directly if its index is known

<summary>Properties</summary>

- Arrays have a fixed size, which means the number of elements they can store is defined when they are created. This makes them static

## Linked List

<details>
<summary>Definition</summary>

- A linked list is also a linear data structure, but unlike arrays, its elements (known as nodes) are not stored in contiguous memory locations. Each node contains the data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence
</details>

<details>
<summary>Properties</summary>

- Linked lists are dynamic, meaning they can grow and shrink in size as needed during runtime. They allow for efficient insertions and deletions because these operations do not require the elements to be contiguous
